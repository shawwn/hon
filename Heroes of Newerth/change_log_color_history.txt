^970Version 2.0.0^*
-------------
== ^970Team Matchmaking^* ==

^292-^* Find matches faster! Boasting arranged-team or solo play, this innovative and intuitive feature increases the efficiency of game creation by automatically gathering player statistics from a variety of group sizes, formulating teams, then matching those teams in as fair a manner as possible. With the ability to customize game mode, region, and map preferences, as well as group up with players on or off your friends list, the new Matchmaking will not only make it much faster to find a game of HoN, but also maximize the fairness and quality of the match.
^292-^* Playing Matchmaking rewards you with valuable Goblin Coins! Check out the new end-game scorescreen function after a Matchmaking game.
^292-^* Matchmaking will be disabled initially, we'll enable it when we're ready to begin public testing on it this week. Once enabled, expect it to have cycles of going up and down as we gather data, iterate, improve the algorithms, and fix any bugs.

== ^970Cosmetic Store^* ==

^292-^* With goblin coin currency, which can be earned or bought, players can purchase in-game brag-worthy cosmetic upgrades. The micro-transaction based store, controlled by Merrick the goblin shopkeeper, lets players customize their experience without affecting game play or allowing the purchases to change the level of competition.

^292-^* Cosmetic upgrades include:
^717*^* Alternate hero avatars
^717*^* Taunt
^717*^* Account icons
^717*^* Alternate announcer packs
^717*^* Name color options.
^717*^* Account Symbols


== ^970New 3v3 Map: Grimm's Crossing^* ==

^292-^* A new action-packed and exciting map that includes a two-way teleporter in the middle area, allowing for more innovative fighting strategies and tactics. Grimm's Crossing is a battlefield for the bloodthirsty. The terrain favors the cunning and aggressive, as hidden paths within the trees can provide a quick way to rout unsuspecting enemies. There is precious little territory to be contested over; battles are won and lost at frantic paces, often beginning and ending unexpectedly.

^292-^* Features of the new map:
^717*^* 2 lanes that are very close together
^717*^* Only one set of towers outside of each base
^717*^* Small, tightly packed map
^717*^* Neutral creeps spawn only in the middle section of the map
^717*^* No elevation at entrances into bases
^717*^* 1 rune spawn location in the center
^717*^* Towers' armor scales with number of players alive; Buildings have 100% of armor when all are alive, scaling to 0 armor when your entire team is dead. This is active if with both Casual and Normal mode on this map.
^717*^* Twin teleporters for quick transit and fun surprises
^717*^* It's a winter wonderland! Try the snow weather on this map!


== ^970New Game Mode: Casual Mode^* ==

^292-^* This entirely new mode of play will provide new HoN players and casual gamers with a more “fun,” less punishing way to learn and play HoN. Elements in Casual Mode speed up progression and increase rewards in ways that remain true to the game's core identity, delivering a version that can be embraced by new and veteran players alike.

^292-^* Changes from Normal Mode to Casual Mode are as follows
^717*^* Exp range from 1000 to 1300
^717*^* Removed gold loss on death
^717*^* Increased hero bounty
^717*^*^717*^* Hero base gold bounty: from 200 to 300
^717*^*^717*^* Hero gold bounty per level: from 5 to 10
^717*^* First blood bonus: from 200 to 300
^717*^* Gold bounty per streak: from 50 to 75
^717*^* Hero assist gold totals 50% of kill amount, split between all assisters
^717*^* Radius assist gold base: from 30 to 0
^717*^* Radius assist gold per level: from 5 to 0
^717*^* Respawn time per level from 4 seconds to 3 seconds
^717*^* Denies no longer deny experience
^717*^* Uphill miss chance removed
^717*^* Creeps give 1.25x of average normal mode value, no gold fluctuation
^717*^* Buildings give 1.5x of average normal mode value, no gold fluctuation
^717*^* Towers give global experience when killed, even to dead people, (by tower level): 150,200,250,300
^717*^* Tower last hit gold bounty: from 470,520,570,620 to 300,350,400,450
^717*^* Tower Team gold bounty: from 200,240,280,320 to 300,350,400,450
^717*^* The amount of experience required to reach the next level increases as the game goes on. This means that at the beginning, players level up a lot faster than in Normal Mode, but in the mid and late game they level up at about the same rate as in Normal Mode.
^717*^* Buyback costs are at 1.75x normal mode values
^717*^* Towers' armor scales with number of players alive; Buildings have 100% of armor when all are alive, scaling to 0 armor when your entire team is dead.


== ^970New Interface Features^* ==

^292-^* We have revamped the in-game interface to be more dynamic, informative, and efficient.

^292-^* Enhancements include:
^717*^* Advanced mini-map interaction. Try hovering over heroes, buildings, or wards!
^717*^* Pull down tabs in the upper right for intuitive access to vote functions and game options
^717*^* Graphic kill messages for feedback when you net a kill in the upper left.
^717*^* A gold counter to see the breakdown of your gold earnings from different sources. Hover your mouse over your gold count to see the exact breakdown!
^717*^* Experience range indicators to mark enemies within the experience gain range. You will notice a small purple diamond next a creep's health bar when you are in range and a purple diamond effect will play when they die if you got experience.
^717*^* Context-sensitive pings to highlight the object and send out alert messages to allies. Try Alt+Clicking an ally, enemy, or building.
^717*^* A hover-over inventory to allow for quicker inventory feedback on allies and enemies. Hover over an enemy to quickly see their inventory.


== ^970BETA Map Editor^* ==

^292-^* With the exact same tool that we used to make HoN, users can now create and edit maps for enhanced single-player experiences. Users who are inspired to create multi-player maps can submit their map designs to the HoN DREAM website for potential inclusion in HoN. Also, in conjunction with scripting manipulation, players can create their own custom modes.
^292-^* This is still a BETA version of the Map Editor, and as such still has features to be added, polish to be done, and bugs to be fixed. Keep this in mind!
^292-^* To open the editor, use the editor.bat file in your HoN directory or re-install the game and it will automatically add a shortcut to your start menu as well


== ^970Weather Effects^* ==

^292- ^*A storm has arrived on Newerth with HoN 2.0 and it shows! Change the weather of the map you are in at any time through the Options menu and feel free to sing in the rain.
^292-^* Players can set their preferred weather effect in the interface options or with a chat command. Right now we support "Rain" and "Snow". The default is "Off".

^292-^* Chat commands are as follows:
^717*^* /weather
^717*^* /weather None
^717*^* /weather Rain
^717*^* /weather Snow

^292-^* We included a text file with instructions on how to make your own weather effects in the HoN directory


== ^970New Item: Spellshards^* ==

^292-^* It's time for the magic users of Newerth to show their true power! With Spellshards, they can pierce the defenses of the enemy and burn them to a crisp that much faster.
^292-^* The wielder's spells ignore a portion of their enemy's magic armor, causing increased magic damage.
^292-^* After obtaining this item, the recipe may be re-purchased to upgrade it. Can be upgraded two additional times.
^292-^* Components: Great Arcana (1675) + Recipe (1000)

^292-^* Stats:
^717*^* 6 Intelligence
^717*^* 17 Damage
^717*^* 10 Attack Speed
^717*^* 3/6/9% Cooldown Reduction
^717*^* 75% Mana Regeneration
^717*^* Causes any Magic damage you deal to ignore 2/4/6 of your target's Magic Armor. This effect can never cause their magic armor to go below 0.

^292-^*[I] Note: The item "Trophy Belt" did not make it into this patch.[/I]


== ^970Nemesis and Payback^* ==

^292-^* Beat down an opponent hard enough and you will become their Nemesis! Be careful, though, for payback is sweet revenge.
^292-^* A 'Nemesis' against an opponent is gained when you kill them 4 times in a row without them killing or assisting in a kill against you.
^292-^* A 'Payback' is given when you kill or help kill your Nemesis.


== ^970New Music^* ==

^292-^* Newerth's citizens, every now and then, take the time away from the battlefield to learn new musical scores. They have brought us six new songs to encourage us in battle!

^292-^* New songs:
^717*^* The Missing Rune
^717*^* Hope
^717*^* From The Depths They Rose
^717*^* The Chase
^717*^* Overrun Lane
^717*^* Kongor's Lair

^292-^* Each map now has a custom music soundtrack that plays songs in a pre-determined order.

^292-^* In addition, several music related bugs were fixed:
^717*^* Fixed music looping
^717*^* Fixed playlist looping
^717*^* Fixed music fade-out/fade-in
^717*^* When a music track is stopped, it defaults to fading out
^717*^* Music is now streamed rather than loaded upfront. This fixes an issue where lower-end computers would randomly hitch when the music switched.
^717*^* When a music track ends, its memory is now freed


== ^970Other Features^* ==

^292-^* BP bans increased from 3 to 4
^292-^* Single draft now has blind pick, meaning you won't see the other team's hero picks during hero selection
^292-^* Banning draft will now switch bans immediately
^292-^* Mid-bar completely redone for HoN 2.0
^292-^* Streak stats are no longer recorded for public games
^292- ^*Fixes for Caldavar so the creeps won't start in tower range in bottom lane and the middle lane will be more even


== ^970General^* ==

^292-^* Fixed GPM calculations. Gold that wasn't counted in GPM before:
^717*^* Passive
^717*^* First blood bounty
^717*^* Assists
^717*^* Radius bounty
^717*^* Was counting how much a player should have lost on death, rather than what he actually lost if he didn't have enough gold

^292-^* Fixed a spot you can hit Kongor from outside of his pit
^292-^* You can now also "buy all components" for items without components and it'll just buy the individual item.
^292-^* Swapping the minimap to right side now also swaps the location of attack modifiers
^292-^* Added sounds to the pause/unpause countdown
^292-^* You can no longer transfer items from your stash onto units that can't carry items
^292-^* Toggling mute on a player no longer /ignores them
^292-^* Tweaked effects, voices, and animations of several heroes
^292-^* A code tweak that will increase load time for computers with limited amount of virtual memory, but should help alleviate crashes due to running out of virtual memory (32 bit Vista and 7)
^292-^* Gold will now max at 65535 instead of looping back to 0
^292-^* Sped up ^090Frostwolf Skull^* projectile to 1500 (medium speed based on high and low ranges)

== ^970Bugfixes^* ==

^717*^* Reworked how matches are formed to more consistently replace players who fail to load and to decrease time to find matches for players with exceptionally high or low SMR ratings
^717*^* Players new to matchmaking must complete 5 provisional matches, in which they will be matched with other new players. If not enough new players are available, they will eventually be matched with regular players. 
^717*^* Players now have the option to set their initial standing according to general skill level, which affects the types of players they will be matched against. The three options are Beginner, Intermediate, and advanced.
^717*^* Solo matchmaking uses Banning Draft (BD)


^970Ingame Changes^*
 
^292- ^*Added a new keybinding: Direct Pathing (Modifer 3)
^717*^* When held down and an order is given (Move, Attack, Cast, etc) will move the hero in a direct path towards where you click no matter what is in the way. Ignores cliffs, heroes, and creeps. Useful for chasing through the woods or pushing yourself against a cliff to cast into the river!
^292-^* Re-arranged some of the shop to put modifers into the correct (bottom) shop. This includes all lifesteal items. Brutalizer and Lightning items are now in the Combat shop. Be wary of your hotkeys!
^292-^* If you buy an item on a courier then transfer that item to your hero, you can now sell that item for its full value within the 15sec sellback period
^292-^* Added game option "Minimap Rightclick" (default on). When disabled, the player cannot rightclick on the minimap.
^292-^* The game will no longer display an incorrect disconnect message indicating that the hero was removed and assets distributed to their team if the disconnected player was a referee or spectator
^292-^* Fixed disconnect messages appearing twice when a player disconnects in game
^292-^* Calling a vote to remake, pause or kick (through the console) before the pre-match game phase will no longer work. (ie. only after the players are loaded into the map can they call these.)
^292-^* If displaying chat timestamps were enabled in game, various game messages sent to both teams were not being timestamped (disconnects, Kongor kills, Barracks destruction, etc). These messages now display the timestamp properly if the client has this option enabled.
^292-^* New death for the legion main building
^292-^* Finally took down our Christmas lights...
^292-^* New Hellbourne sounds and effects for buildings
^292-^* Random small chest sound/model fixes

^292-^* Unpause now plays a noise so players are aware
^292-^* Fixed some neutral NPC sounds playing globally
^292-^* Updated map to remove texture seams
^292-^* Added a visible 'corpse' for NPCs dying
^292-^* Heroes can no longer pickup runes while stunned
^292-^* Referees are now treated as spectators
^717*^* Fixes the fog issue, allows them to see the scoreboard, allows them to talk with other referees and spectators
^292-^* Added some environmental sound effects on Caldavar

^292-^* Fixed some tooltips for items in the shop
^292-^* Fixed spectators at 1920x1080 resolution

^970Pre-Game Changes^*

^292-^* Pressing ALT in the game lobby will now toggle the chat mode between "Team" and "All" chat modes.
^292-^* Moved the Ping/Players/Version labels in the game lobby a bit to the right as we weren't making use of the space and server names with long names like those we use for South Africa overlapped into these labels
^292-^* Voice chat indicator/mute button shows up in the hero picker/etc. now (on the inner side of the hero name)
^292-^* Pressing the "All/Team" button in the game lobby will now set focus to the chat input line

^292-^* Increase the max spectator slots to 10
^292-^* Fixed the Alternate Picking crash
^292-^* The host option "Disband" has been changed to "Disconnect", Upon disconnecting the game server will assign another  player as the host and print a message to the game lobby indicating the transfer of hosting privileges


^970General Changes^*

^292-^* Replays now begin recording during the picking phase
^292-^* Removed the "Tier" filters, columns and inputs from the game browser and create game interface
^292-^* Added filters, sortable columns and all inputs for Min/Max PSR to the game browser and create game interface
^717*^* Players may now specify a Min/Max PSR range when creating a game. Min/Max PSR games will appear normally as they would in the game browser and other players may join a game if their PSR falls within 2% of the range the game server Min/Max PSR is set to. (This means a player with 1471 PSR should be able to make it into a game marked Min 1500, and a 1734 player would be able to join a game marked as Max 1700, but those are the very edge of the 2% tolerance, so anything higher or lower would be rejected.)
^292-^* Games outside of a player's PSR range are grayed out in the game browser similar to the way "No Leaver" games appear to a player with leaver status. If no range is specified when the game is created then no range is enforced. If a player is invited to a game, the server ignores the PSR restrictions for them allowing friends to play in games they may not normally be able to be playing
^292-^* Added Min/Max PSR to the /gi or /gameinfo commands
^292-^* The players PSR is now retrieved stored locally on the client when logging in, and is accessible through the UI_CMD() GetPSR()
^292-^* Removed the ticks, grinds, and blips and whatnot that were playing when the game started up
^292-^* Added an option "Disable Background Effects" that allows users to toggle whether or not all the background lobby effects and animations are played. (Credit to Pancakeslp for the original mod)
^292-^* Fixed some buddy request/add notifications playing sounds a bunch of times when logging in if a player had those notifications saved in their history
^292-^* The Notification Duration slider under options->interface now sets the duration (1-15 seconds) a notification is displayed for
^292-^* Fixed a number of incorrectly labeled tooltips on the options menu. Disabled the "Health/Mana Bar Scale" in the options
^292-^* Removed the "Options" menu from the F10 in game menu
^292-^* Fixed "Add PlayerName" buttons on options menu to align properly and correctly add the player clicked on
^292-^* Increased max size of joinable channels to 30
^292-^* Using the slash command /join <channelname> "password" will now attempt to join the channel with the password specified. (Anything in between the quotes at the end becomes the password)
^292-^* Fixed some issues in the client/interface causing the change password dialogue to not work
^292-^* Fixed the lock/unlocked tooltip for hosts to display the correct tip (was previously showing the opposite tooltip it should have been showing)
^292-^* Players can now select Logon/Logoff and Join/Leave Game notification settings for clan members separately from the notifications they select for their friends
^292-^* Fixed an issue where notifications were not being saved to the history properly
^292-^* Fixed the default notification time to be 10 seconds instead of 10000
^292-^* Updated sub-account description
^292-^* Removed "Show Menu Transitions" from the options menu as the option is not currently being used
^292- ^*Fixed iris closing sound being heard on disconnect
^292-^* Fixed "/r" to not reply to a clan whisper automatically with "/c m", instead it will reply directly to the sender with a "/w PlayerName" just like how "/b m" works
^292-^* Trying out new color for the selected item in listboxes
^292-^* Fixed the "Show Winner" button on the match stats screen to correctly display and announce the team who won
^292-^* Fixed sound driver list sometimes showing the current driver incorrectly
^717*^* This means the sound system will only restart if it is indeed necessary
^292-^* Fixed a couple places where linux system class was using incorrect character conversions
^292-^* Added console command "precacheworld <mapname>". So for example type "precacheworld caldavar" to precache its resources
^292-^* Removed cvar browser_maxPing as it was not being used
^292-^* Invisible Mode will now remember its state the next time the game re-loads
^292- ^*Players in "Invisible Mode" will no longer auto join default HoN or Clan channels when leaving a game, allowing them to properly remain in a hidden state
^292-^* Clicking on the clock in the system bar now toggles between 12 hour and 24 hour display
^292-^* Re-arranged Public and Create Game interfaces to make more space and added icons/checkboxes for the new "Hardcore" and  "Dev Heroes" game options
^292- ^*Moved "Alt Hero Picking" on the Create Game interface to an Advanced Option, which is what it is actually categorized as

^292- ^*Added new search support for filtering  games by name:
^717* ^*Added feature to allow players to type in  multiple search phrases. By typing a search phrase and adding a ?|? the  client will distinguish one phrase from another. The browser will then  search the available games and show any games showing any one of the  phrases separated by a "|".
^717* ^*Added feature to allow players to exclude  certain games based on the search phrase. By typing in a "-" at the  beginning of the search phrase the client will automatically filter any  games with "Phrase" to not show up. Note that exclusion of search terms  takes precedence over inclusion. (Excluding a term, and then trying to  include the same term will cause it not to appear, ie ?noobs|-noobs?)
^717* ^*The "|" and "-" can be escaped with a "\"  should the player want to search on a game with the pipe or hyphen in  it.
^717* ^*All searches are color and case  insensitive, and the order that the search phrases are entered have no  effect on how they will display. So "1500|-no ab" is the same as "-no  ab|1500".

Some examples:
^717*^*Search Phrase: "1550|1600|1650|-no  ab|-noobs" - This searches on any game with "1550", "1600", and "1650"  in the name, and if it has the words "no ab" or "noobs" in it it will  not display.
^717*^*Search Phrase: "-no  ab|1500|1550|-countryname|ab" - This searches on any game with "1500",  "1550" and "ab" in the name, and if it has the words "no ab" or  "countryname" in it it will not display.
^717*^*Search Phrase: "1500|\-SDEM|pipe\|test" -  This searches on any game with "1500", "-sdem" and "pipe|test" in the  name.
