Version 2.0.0
-------------
== Team Matchmaking ==

- Find matches faster! Boasting arranged-team or solo play, this innovative and intuitive feature increases the efficiency of game creation by automatically gathering player statistics from a variety of group sizes, formulating teams, then matching those teams in as fair a manner as possible. With the ability to customize game mode, region, and map preferences, as well as group up with players on or off your friends list, the new Matchmaking will not only make it much faster to find a game of HoN, but also maximize the fairness and quality of the match.
- Playing Matchmaking rewards you with valuable Goblin Coins! Check out the new end-game scorescreen function after a Matchmaking game.
- Matchmaking will be disabled initially, we'll enable it when we're ready to begin public testing on it this week. Once enabled, expect it to have cycles of going up and down as we gather data, iterate, improve the algorithms, and fix any bugs.

== Cosmetic Store ==

- With goblin coin currency, which can be earned or bought, players can purchase in-game brag-worthy cosmetic upgrades. The micro-transaction based store, controlled by Merrick the goblin shopkeeper, lets players customize their experience without affecting game play or allowing the purchases to change the level of competition.

- Cosmetic upgrades include:
* Alternate hero avatars
* Taunt
* Account icons
* Alternate announcer packs
* Name color options.
* Account Symbols


== New 3v3 Map: Grimm's Crossing ==

- A new action-packed and exciting map that includes a two-way teleporter in the middle area, allowing for more innovative fighting strategies and tactics. Grimm's Crossing is a battlefield for the bloodthirsty. The terrain favors the cunning and aggressive, as hidden paths within the trees can provide a quick way to rout unsuspecting enemies. There is precious little territory to be contested over; battles are won and lost at frantic paces, often beginning and ending unexpectedly.

- Features of the new map:
* 2 lanes that are very close together
* Only one set of towers outside of each base
* Small, tightly packed map
* Neutral creeps spawn only in the middle section of the map
* No elevation at entrances into bases
* 1 rune spawn location in the center
* Towers' armor scales with number of players alive; Buildings have 100% of armor when all are alive, scaling to 0 armor when your entire team is dead. This is active if with both Casual and Normal mode on this map.
* Twin teleporters for quick transit and fun surprises
* It's a winter wonderland! Try the snow weather on this map!


== New Game Mode: Casual Mode ==

- This entirely new mode of play will provide new HoN players and casual gamers with a more “fun,” less punishing way to learn and play HoN. Elements in Casual Mode speed up progression and increase rewards in ways that remain true to the game's core identity, delivering a version that can be embraced by new and veteran players alike.

- Changes from Normal Mode to Casual Mode are as follows
* Exp range from 1000 to 1300
* Removed gold loss on death
* Increased hero bounty
** Hero base gold bounty: from 200 to 300
** Hero gold bounty per level: from 5 to 10
* First blood bonus: from 200 to 300
* Gold bounty per streak: from 50 to 75
* Hero assist gold totals 50% of kill amount, split between all assisters
* Radius assist gold base: from 30 to 0
* Radius assist gold per level: from 5 to 0
* Respawn time per level from 4 seconds to 3 seconds
* Denies no longer deny experience
* Uphill miss chance removed
* Creeps give 1.25x of average normal mode value, no gold fluctuation
* Buildings give 1.5x of average normal mode value, no gold fluctuation
* Towers give global experience when killed, even to dead people, (by tower level): 150,200,250,300
* Tower last hit gold bounty: from 470,520,570,620 to 300,350,400,450
* Tower Team gold bounty: from 200,240,280,320 to 300,350,400,450
* The amount of experience required to reach the next level increases as the game goes on. This means that at the beginning, players level up a lot faster than in Normal Mode, but in the mid and late game they level up at about the same rate as in Normal Mode.
* Buyback costs are at 1.75x normal mode values
* Towers' armor scales with number of players alive; Buildings have 100% of armor when all are alive, scaling to 0 armor when your entire team is dead.


== New Interface Features ==

- We have revamped the in-game interface to be more dynamic, informative, and efficient.

- Enhancements include:
* Advanced mini-map interaction. Try hovering over heroes, buildings, or wards!
* Pull down tabs in the upper right for intuitive access to vote functions and game options
* Graphic kill messages for feedback when you net a kill in the upper left.
* A gold counter to see the breakdown of your gold earnings from different sources. Hover your mouse over your gold count to see the exact breakdown!
* Experience range indicators to mark enemies within the experience gain range. You will notice a small purple diamond next a creep's health bar when you are in range and a purple diamond effect will play when they die if you got experience.
* Context-sensitive pings to highlight the object and send out alert messages to allies. Try Alt+Clicking an ally, enemy, or building.
* A hover-over inventory to allow for quicker inventory feedback on allies and enemies. Hover over an enemy to quickly see their inventory.


== BETA Map Editor ==

- With the exact same tool that we used to make HoN, users can now create and edit maps for enhanced single-player experiences. Users who are inspired to create multi-player maps can submit their map designs to the HoN DREAM website for potential inclusion in HoN. Also, in conjunction with scripting manipulation, players can create their own custom modes.
- This is still a BETA version of the Map Editor, and as such still has features to be added, polish to be done, and bugs to be fixed. Keep this in mind!
- To open the editor, use the editor.bat file in your HoN directory or re-install the game and it will automatically add a shortcut to your start menu as well


== Weather Effects ==

- A storm has arrived on Newerth with HoN 2.0 and it shows! Change the weather of the map you are in at any time through the Options menu and feel free to sing in the rain.
- Players can set their preferred weather effect in the interface options or with a chat command. Right now we support "Rain" and "Snow". The default is "Off".

- Chat commands are as follows:
* /weather
* /weather None
* /weather Rain
* /weather Snow

- We included a text file with instructions on how to make your own weather effects in the HoN directory


== New Item: Spellshards ==

- It's time for the magic users of Newerth to show their true power! With Spellshards, they can pierce the defenses of the enemy and burn them to a crisp that much faster.
- The wielder's spells ignore a portion of their enemy's magic armor, causing increased magic damage.
- After obtaining this item, the recipe may be re-purchased to upgrade it. Can be upgraded two additional times.
- Components: Great Arcana (1675) + Recipe (1000)

- Stats:
* 6 Intelligence
* 17 Damage
* 10 Attack Speed
* 3/6/9% Cooldown Reduction
* 75% Mana Regeneration
* Causes any Magic damage you deal to ignore 2/4/6 of your target's Magic Armor. This effect can never cause their magic armor to go below 0.

- Note: The item "Trophy Belt" did not make it into this patch.


== Nemesis and Payback ==

- Beat down an opponent hard enough and you will become their Nemesis! Be careful, though, for payback is sweet revenge.
- A 'Nemesis' against an opponent is gained when you kill them 4 times in a row without them killing or assisting in a kill against you.
- A 'Payback' is given when you kill or help kill your Nemesis.


== New Music ==

- Newerth's citizens, every now and then, take the time away from the battlefield to learn new musical scores. They have brought us six new songs to encourage us in battle!

- New songs:
* The Missing Rune
* Hope
* From The Depths They Rose
* The Chase
* Overrun Lane
* Kongor's Lair

- Each map now has a custom music soundtrack that plays songs in a pre-determined order.

* Fixed music looping
* Fixed playlist looping
* Fixed music fade-out/fade-in
* When a music track is stopped, it defaults to fading out

- Fixed GPM calculations. Gold that wasn't counted in GPM before:

* First blood bounty

Darkwood Vale

- Removed two neutral spawns, replaced them with outposts

Ingame

- Set the max channel chat message (250), max game chat message (150), chat channel topic (140), and channel name length (30).

- The channel name + topic area of the channel is now truncated off properly and no longer wraps off the panel onto the rest of the UI for long channel topics
- Added a hovertip to the channel name + topic so if the topic is 95+ chars, if you hover over it it displays the full topic, similar to how long game names work in the Public Game interface

Matchmaking 2.0

* Reworked how matches are formed to more consistently replace players who fail to load and to decrease time to find matches for players with exceptionally high or low SMR ratings
* Players new to matchmaking must complete 5 provisional matches, in which they will be matched with other new players. If not enough new players are available, they will eventually be matched with regular players. 
* Players new to matchmaking have the option to set their initial SMR according to general skill level. The three options are Beginner (1300), Intermediate (1500), and advanced (1700).
* Solo matchmaking now uses Banning Draft instead of Banning Pick


Ingame Changes

- Added a new keybinding: Direct Pathing
* When held down and an order is given (Move, Attack, Cast, etc) will move the hero in a direct path towards where you click no matter what is in the way. Ignores cliffs, heroes, and creeps. Useful for chasing through the woods or pushing yourself against a cliff to cast into the river!
- Re-arranged some of the shop to put modifers into the correct (bottom) shop. This includes all lifesteal items. Brutalizer and Lightning items are now in the Combat shop. Be wary of your hotkeys!
- If you buy an item on a courier then transfer that item to your hero, you can now sell that item for its full value within the 15sec sellback period
- Added game option "Minimap Rightclick" (default on). When disabled, the player cannot rightclick on the minimap.
- The game will no longer display an incorrect disconnect message indicating that the hero was removed and assets distributed to their team if the disconnected player was a referee or spectator
- Fixed disconnect messages appearing twice when a player disconnects in game
- Calling a vote to remake, pause or kick (through the console) before the pre-match game phase will no longer work. (ie. only after the players are loaded into the map can they call these.)
- If displaying chat timestamps were enabled in game, various game messages sent to both teams were not being timestamped (disconnects, Kongor kills, Barracks destruction, etc). These messages now display the timestamp properly if the client has this option enabled.

- Finally took down our Christmas lights...

Pre-Game Changes

- Pressing ALT in the game lobby will now toggle the chat mode between "Team" and "All" chat modes.

General Changes

- Replays now begin recording during the picking phase
- Removed the "Tier" filters, columns and inputs from the game browser and create game interface
- Added filters, sortable columns and all inputs for Min/Max PSR to the game browser and create game interface
* Players may now specify a Min/Max PSR range when creating a game. Min/Max PSR games will appear normally as they would in the game browser and other players may join a game if their PSR falls within 2% of the range the game server Min/Max PSR is set to. (This means a player with 1471 PSR should be able to make it into a game marked Min 1500, and a 1734 player would be able to join a game marked as Max 1700, but those are the very edge of the 2% tolerance, so anything higher or lower would be rejected.)
- Games outside of a player's PSR range are grayed out in the game browser similar to the way "No Leaver" games appear to a player with leaver status. If no range is specified when the game is created then no range is enforced. If a player is invited to a game, the server ignores the PSR restrictions for them allowing friends to play in games they may not normally be able to be playing
- Added Min/Max PSR to the /gi or /gameinfo commands
- The players PSR is now retrieved stored locally on the client when logging in, and is accessible through the UI_CMD() GetPSR()
- Removed the ticks, grinds, and blips and whatnot that were playing when the game started up
- Added an option "Disable Background Effects" that allows users to toggle whether or not all the background lobby effects and animations are played. (Credit to Pancakeslp for the original mod)
- Fixed some buddy request/add notifications playing sounds a bunch of times when logging in if a player had those notifications saved in their history
- The Notification Duration slider under options->interface now sets the duration (1-15 seconds) a notification is displayed for
- Fixed a number of incorrectly labeled tooltips on the options menu. Disabled the "Health/Mana Bar Scale" in the options
- Removed the "Options" menu from the F10 in game menu
- Fixed "Add PlayerName" buttons on options menu to align properly and correctly add the player clicked on
- Increased max size of joinable channels to 30
- Using the slash command /join <channelname> "password" will now attempt to join the channel with the password specified. (Anything in between the quotes at the end becomes the password)
- Fixed some issues in the client/interface causing the change password dialogue to not work
- Fixed the lock/unlocked tooltip for hosts to display the correct tip (was previously showing the opposite tooltip it should have been showing)

- Added new "Ping" filter next to the "Full Games" checkbox. It filters the results on the client so only pings less the chosen number populate the game list
- Added a new filter option to the server browser "Game Mode:" section called "Advanced". It allows players to filter multiple game modes (ie. SD, BD, BP) all at once locally in the client. Upon selecting 'Advanced' a small panel pops up and the player can choose the game modes they want to see in the game list just by selecting the appropriate checkbox then clicking OK
- Default SFX volume down to 0.6 from 0.7
- Fixed an issue with the chat server where if a user sent a message using /b or /m and someone on one of those lists was in /dnd mode, it wouldn't send the message to all the people on the list.
- Overhauled how adding buddies/friends works. You now must request friendship before someone is actually added as your friend.
* You can request friends when offline and they will get the notifications upon logging in, and approve at their convenience
* We might have to wipe current friends lists at some point in the future for this to work correctly.

- Added new search support for filtering games by name:
* Added feature to allow players to type in multiple search phrases. By typing a search phrase and adding a ?|? the client will distinguish one phrase from another. The browser will then search the available games and show any games showing any one of the phrases separated by a "|".
* Added feature to allow players to exclude certain games based on the search phrase. By typing in a "-" at the beginning of the search phrase the client will automatically filter any games with "Phrase" to not show up. Note that exclusion of search terms takes precedence over inclusion. (Excluding a term, and then trying to include the same term will cause it not to appear, ie ?noobs|-noobs?)
* The "|" and "-" can be escaped with a "\" should the player want to search on a game with the pipe or hyphen in it.
* All searches are color and case insensitive, and the order that the search phrases are entered have no effect on how they will display. So "1500|-no ab" is the same as "-no ab|1500".

Some examples:
*Search Phrase: "1550|1600|1650|-no ab|-noobs" - This searches on any game with "1550", "1600", and "1650" in the name, and if it has the words "no ab" or "noobs" in it it will not display.
*Search Phrase: "-no ab|1500|1550|-countryname|ab" - This searches on any game with "1500", "1550" and "ab" in the name, and if it has the words "no ab" or "countryname" in it it will not display.
*Search Phrase: "1500|\-SDEM|pipe\|test" - This searches on any game with "1500", "-sdem" and "pipe|test" in the name.

Version 0.1.65
--------------
General

- Significant Lane Creep AI changes
* These all involve the assist trigger that causes the creeps to aggro you when you attack an enemy hero:
1. When a hero causes the assist trigger to go off, there is a 200ms delay before the creeps will turn and come at you
2. Creeps will chase for exactly 1600ms (down from 1800ms)
3. If a creep is in the middle of an attack animation but has not hit its attack impact point (600ms), it will deagro and stop its attack as long as you are out of it's short melee range
* AKA: Creeps will not finish attacks they start on you if they hit the end of the trigger
4. A creep must deal damage before it can be called by the assist trigger again
* This means if you tug, they must turn around and actually deal damage to a unit before it can chase again
5. You must be within 600 units of an enemy hero to cause the assist trigger to go off

New hero: Magmus, based off DOTA hero Sand King
The primordial and elemental creature known as Magmus is no demon, though he fights alongside the Hellbourne.  Rather, he was drawn forth from the earth, as evil calls to evil and separate flames join to form an inferno.  A holdover from an ancient, cataclysmic age of fire, Magmus dreams of returning Newerth to ash, lava, and cinder, and he wields his considerable might and magic in that terrible cause.
- Ability 1 - Lava Surge 
* Riding on lava, Magmus surges toward a target location, damaging and stunning enemy units in his path.
- Ability 2 - Steam Bath 
* Magmus releases extreme heat, toasting the area around him. The resulting steam damages nearby enemy units over time and cloaks Magmus from enemy eyes.
- Ability 3 - Volcanic Touch
* Upon attacking enemy units, Magmus' flaming mace instills an intense heat in them. If they die while under the effects of this intense heat, they explode, damaging the nearby enemies of Magmus.
- Ability 4 - Eruption
* Magmus channels the power of the lava, releasing it after a short delay. The resulting lava grows over time, damaging nearby enemies over several seconds.

- Shieldbreaker now applies its armor reduction state before the damage of the attack is calculated
* This means that the first attack for units using a Shieldbreaker will do the correct amount of damage

- Enhanced Marchers armor reduced from 7 to 5, state duration increased from 5 to 6 seconds, cooldown increased from 10 to 12 seconds

================
= New Features =
================

Pub Skill Rating
- Pub Skill Rating is a rough estimation of player skill level from public (non-ranked) games. It is an ELO based value that accounts for who you are winning and losing to. Note that it will take 20 games for your PSR to become valid, and before then it won't be displayed.
- Included with the PSR system is a team balance feature for game hosts to use, which will attempt to balance the game based on the players' PSR.

* It should be noted that this map has received limited internal testing and tweaking. With that in mind, please report any and all issues you find on the forum

New Hero: Valkyrie, based off DOTA hero Priestess of the Moon
- The ancient sagas of the heathen north have long told to the tale of the battle-women known as Valkyries.  For centuries, their ranks have thinned as the old ways have died out and civilization stretched its smothering hand over the frozen wilds.  But some Valkyries still remain, cold and swift as the north wind, wielding their lances with expertise to rival the most veteran Legion warriors.
- Ability 1: Call of the Valkyrie
* Valkyrie calls forth several Battle Maidens to damage nearby enemies.
