Version 0.2.60
-------------
- Inital test of the matchmaking overhaul
- Next version of the legion main building death

- Removed the "Tier" filters, columns and inputs from the game browser and create game interface.
- Added filters, sortable columns and all inputs for Min/Max PSR to the game browser and create game interface.
* Players may now specify a Min/Max PSR range when creating a game.  Min/Max PSR games will appear normally as they would in the game browser and other players may join a game if their PSR falls within 2% of the range the game server Min/Max  PSR is set to.  (This means a player with 1471 PSR should be able to make it into a game marked Min 1500, and a 1734  player would be able to join a game marked as Max 1700, but those are the very edge of the 2% tolerance, so anything  higher or lower would be rejected.)
- Games outside of a player's PSR range are grayed out in the game browser similar to the way "No Leaver" games appear to  a player with leaver status. If no range is specified when the game is created then no range is enforced.  If a player is  invited to a game, the server ignores the PSR restrictions for them allowing friends to play in games they may not  normally be able to be playing
- Added Min/Max PSR to the /gi or /gameinfo commands.
- The players PSR is now retrieved stored locally on the client when logging in, and is accessible through the UI_CMD() GetPSR()

- Added new "Ping" filter next to the "Full Games" checkbox. It filters the results  on the client so only pings less the chosen number populate the game list.

- Added new search support for filtering games by name:
* Added feature to allow players to type in multiple search phrases.  By typing a search phrase and adding a | the client will distinguish one phrase from another. The browser will then search the available games and show any games showing any one of the phrases separated by a "|".
* Added feature to allow players to exclude certain games based on the search phrase.  By typing in a "-" at the beginning of the search phrase the client will automatically filter any games with "Phrase" to not show up.  Note that exclusion of search terms takes precedence over inclusion.  (Excluding a term, and then trying to include the same term will cause it not to appear, ie noobs|-noobs)
* The "|" and "-" can be escaped with a "\" should the player want to search on a game with the pipe or hyphen in it.
* All searches are color and case insensitive, and the order that the search phrases are entered have no effect on how they will display.  So "1500|-no ab" is the same as "-no ab|1500".

Some examples:
search Phrase: "1550|1600|1650|-no ab|-noobs" - This searches on any game with "1550", "1600", and "1650" in the name, and if it has the words "no ab" or "noobs" in it it will not display.
search Phrase: "-no ab|1500|1550|-countryname|ab" - This searches on any game with "1500", "1550" and "ab" in the name, and if it has the words "no ab" or "countryname" in it it will not display.
search Phrase: "1500|\-SDEM|pipe\|test" - This searches on any game with "1500", "-sdem" and "pipe|test" in the name.
