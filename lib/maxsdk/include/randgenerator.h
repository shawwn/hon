	DESCRIPTION: Generator of random numbers

	CREATED BY: Oleg Bayborodin

	HISTORY: Nov.17 2000 - created

	GOALS: To solve the need in satisfactory generator of random numbers.

	DESCRIPTION: The class has interfaces for srand/rand methods of VC++ 
		and other functions for random number generation.

		Srand/rand methods from stdlib.h have two main problems:
		a) It's not satisfactory random. Since rand() function returns a 
			pseudorandom integer in the range 0 to 0x7fff=32767, if we
			need a lot of random numbers (i.e. for generating 100,000 
			particles), we are running out of continuity of random num-
			bers. Generated random numbers became too discrete.
		b) rand() method is global function, not class object. Hence it's
			shared between all modules of your plug-in. Changes in one
			module may change randomness pattern in other independent 
			module. To solve this contradiction, rand methods have to be
			implemented as a class object.

		RandGenerator does exactly that. It has much more random numbers:
		RAND_MAX = 0xFFFFFFFF = 4,294,967,295. Also, using instance of 
		the class, it's much easier to create separate thread of random 
		numbers for specific module.
