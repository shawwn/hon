/*
 * This class defines a Pseudo-random number generator that precisely
 * matches the behavior of the MSVCRT 6.0 random routines.
 * That is to say, for equivalent calls to ::srand() and Random::srand(),
 * both ::rand() and Random::rand() will produce the same results.
 *
 * The benefit, however, in having this class is that each instantiation
 * is independent, permitting several uncoupled random number generators
 * to be present in the system at once.  Moreover, each instantiation
 * is automatically "pre-seeded", making calls to Random::srand unnecessary
 * in most uses.  Even arrays of Random items will operate independently.
 *
 * In addition to providing the analogues to the "stdlib" functions, this
 * class also provides two useful member functions which can be used
 * to get a random number bounded in either a float or int interval.
