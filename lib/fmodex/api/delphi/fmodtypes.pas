    [DESCRIPTION]   
    These output types are used with FMOD_System_SetOutput/FMOD_System_GetOutput, to choose which output method to use.
  
    [REMARKS]
    To pass information to the driver when initializing fmod use the extradriverdata parameter in System::init for the following reasons.
    - FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_WAVWRITER - extradriverdata is a pointer to a char * filename that the wav writer will output to.
    - FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_WAVWRITER_NRT - extradriverdata is a pointer to a char * filename that the wav writer will output to.
    - FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_DSOUND - extradriverdata is a pointer to a HWND so that FMOD can set the focus on the audio for a particular window.
    - FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_GC - extradriverdata is a pointer to a FMOD_ARAMBLOCK_INFO struct. This can be found in fmodgc.h.
    - FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_ALSA - extradriverdata is a pointer to a char * argument if required by the chosen ALSA driver. 
    Currently these are the only FMOD drivers that take extra information.  Other unknown plugins may have different requirements.
    
    Note! If FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_NOSOUND_NRT or FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_NOSOUND_NRT are used, and if the System::update function is being called
    very quickly (ie for a non realtime decode) it may be being called too quickly for the FMOD streamer thread to respond to.  
    The result will be a skipping/stuttering output in the captured audio.
    To remedy this, disable the FMOD Ex streamer thread, and use FMOD_INIT_STREAM_FROM_UPDATE can be used to avoid skipping in 
    the output stream, as it will lock the mixer and the streamer together in the same thread.

    [DESCRIPTION]   
    These are speaker types defined for use with the FMOD_System_SetSpeakerMode or FMOD_System_GetSpeakerMode command.

    [REMARKS]
    These are important notes on speaker modes in regards to sounds created with FMOD_SOFTWARE.
    Note below the phrase 'sound channels' is used.  These are the subchannels inside a sound, they are not related and 
    have nothing to do with the FMOD class "FMOD_CHANNEL".
    For example a mono sound has 1 sound channel, a stereo sound has 2 sound channels, and an AC3 or 6 channel wav file have 6 "sound channels".
    
    FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_NONE
    ---------------------
    This mode is for output devices that are not specifically mono/stereo/quad/surround/5.1 or 7.1, but are multichannel.
    Sound channels map to speakers sequentially, so a mono sound maps to output speaker 0, stereo sound maps to output speaker 0 & 1.
    The user assumes knowledge of the speaker order.  FMOD_SPEAKER enumerations may not apply, so raw channel indicies should be used.
    Multichannel sounds map input channels to output channels 1:1. 
    Channel::setPan and Channel::setSpeakerMix do not work.
    Speaker levels must be manually set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels.
    
    FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_MONO
    ---------------------
    This mode is for a 1 speaker arrangement.
    Panning does not work in this speaker mode.
    Mono, stereo and multichannel sounds have each sound channel played on the one speaker unity.
    Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels.
    Channel::setSpeakerMix does not work.
    
    FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_STEREO
    -----------------------
    This mode is for 2 speaker arrangements that have a left and right speaker.
    - Mono sounds default to an even distribution between left and right.  They can be panned with Channel::setPan.
    - Stereo sounds default to the middle, or full left in the left speaker and full right in the right speaker.  
    - They can be cross faded with Channel::setPan.
    - Multichannel sounds have each sound channel played on each speaker at unity.
    - Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels.
    - Channel::setSpeakerMix works but only front left and right parameters are used, the rest are ignored.
    
    FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_QUAD
    ------------------------
    This mode is for 4 speaker arrangements that have a front left, front right, rear left and a rear right speaker.
    - Mono sounds default to an even distribution between front left and front right.  They can be panned with Channel::setPan.
    - Stereo sounds default to the left sound channel played on the front left, and the right sound channel played on the front right.
    - They can be cross faded with Channel::setPan.
    - Multichannel sounds default to all of their sound channels being played on each speaker in order of input.
    - Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels.
    - Channel::setSpeakerMix works but side left, side right, center and lfe are ignored.
    
    FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_SURROUND
    ------------------------
    This mode is for 4 speaker arrangements that have a front left, front right, front center and a rear center.
    - Mono sounds default to the center speaker.  They can be panned with Channel::setPan.
    - Stereo sounds default to the left sound channel played on the front left, and the right sound channel played on the front right.  
    - They can be cross faded with Channel::setPan.
    - Multichannel sounds default to all of their sound channels being played on each speaker in order of input.
    - Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels.
    - Channel::setSpeakerMix works but side left, side right and lfe are ignored, and rear left / rear right are averaged into the rear speaker.
    
    FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_5POINT1
    ------------------------
    This mode is for 5.1 speaker arrangements that have a left/right/center/rear left/rear right and a subwoofer speaker.
    - Mono sounds default to the center speaker.  They can be panned with Channel::setPan.
    - Stereo sounds default to the left sound channel played on the front left, and the right sound channel played on the front right.  
    - They can be cross faded with Channel::setPan.
    - Multichannel sounds default to all of their sound channels being played on each speaker in order of input.  
    - Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels.
    - Channel::setSpeakerMix works but side left / side right are ignored.
    
    FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_7POINT1
    ------------------------
    This mode is for 7.1 speaker arrangements that have a left/right/center/rear left/rear right/side left/side right 
    and a subwoofer speaker.
    - Mono sounds default to the center speaker.  They can be panned with Channel::setPan.
    - Stereo sounds default to the left sound channel played on the front left, and the right sound channel played on the front right.  
    - They can be cross faded with Channel::setPan.
    - Multichannel sounds default to all of their sound channels being played on each speaker in order of input.  
    - Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels.
    - Channel::setSpeakerMix works and every parameter is used to set the balance of a sound in any speaker.
    
    FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_PROLOGIC
    ------------------------------------------------------
    This mode is for mono, stereo, 5.1 and 7.1 speaker arrangements, as it is backwards and forwards compatible with stereo, 
    but to get a surround effect a Dolby Prologic or Prologic 2 hardware decoder / amplifier is needed.
    Pan behaviour is the same as FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_5POINT1.
    
    If this function is called the numoutputchannels setting in System::setSoftwareFormat is overwritten.
    
    For 3D sounds, panning is determined at runtime by the 3D subsystem based on the speaker mode to determine which speaker the 
    sound should be placed in.

    [DESCRIPTION]   
    List of windowing methods used in spectrum analysis to reduce leakage / transient signals intefering with the analysis.
    This is a problem with analysis of continuous signals that only have a small portion of the signal sample (the fft window size).
    Windowing the signal with a curve or triangle tapers the sides of the fft window to help alleviate this problem.

    [REMARKS]
    Cyclic signals such as a sine wave that repeat their cycle in a multiple of the window size do not need windowing.
    I.e. If the sine wave repeats every 1024, 512, 256 etc samples and the FMOD fft window is 1024, then the signal would not need windowing.
    Not windowing is the same as FMOD_DSP_FFT_WINDOW_RECT, which is the default.
    If the cycle of the signal (ie the sine wave) is not a multiple of the window size, it will cause frequency abnormalities, so a different windowing method is needed.

    The possible reasons to use this with FMOD_System_CreateSound are:
    - Loading a file from memory.
    - Loading a file from within another file, giving an offset and length.
    - To create a user created / non file based sound.
    - To specify a starting subsound to seek to within a multi-sample sounds (ie FSB/DLS/SF2) when created as a stream.
    - To specify which subsounds to load for multi-sample sounds (ie FSB/DLS/SF2) so that memory is saved and only a subset is actually loaded/read from disk.
    - To specify 'piggyback' read and seek callbacks for capture of sound data as fmod reads and decodes it.  Useful for ripping decoded PCM data from sounds as they are loaded / played.
    - To specify a MIDI DLS/SF2 sample set file to load when opening a MIDI file.
    See below on what members to fill for each of the above types of sound you want to create.

    [REMARKS]
    This structure is optional!  Specify 0 or NULL in FMOD_System_CreateSound if you don't need it!

    Members marked with [in] mean the variable can be written to.  The user can set the value.
    Members marked with [out] mean the variable is modified by FMOD and is for reading purposes only.  Do not change this value.

    Loading a file from memory.
    ---------------------------
    - Create the sound using the FMOD_OPENMEMORY flag.
    - Mandatory.  Specify 'length' for the size of the memory block in bytes.
    - Other flags are optional.
        
    Loading a file from within another larger (possibly wad/pak) file, by giving the loader an offset and length.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Create the sound using the FMOD_OPENUSER flag.
    - Mandatory.  Specify 'defaultfrequency, 'numchannels' and 'format'.
    - Other flags are optional.    
    
    To specify a starting subsound to seek to and flush with, within a multi-sample stream (ie FSB/DLS/SF2).
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
    - Mandatory.  Specify 'initialsubsound'.    
    
    To specify which subsounds to load for multi-sample sounds (ie FSB/DLS/SF2) so that memory is saved and only a subset is actually loaded/read from disk.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Mandatory.  Specify 'inclusionlist' and 'inclusionlistnum'.    
    
    To specify 'piggyback' read and seek callbacks for capture of sound data as fmod reads and decodes it.  Useful for ripping decoded PCM data from sounds as they are loaded / played.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    - Mandatory.  Specify 'pcmreadcallback' and 'pcmseekcallback'.
        
    To specify a MIDI DLS/SF2 sample set file to load when opening a MIDI file.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    - Mandatory.  Specify 'dlsname'.    
    
    Setting the 'decodebuffersize' is for cpu intensive codecs that may be causing stuttering, not file intensive codecs (ie those from CD or netstreams) which are normally altered with System::setStreamBufferSize.  As an example of cpu intensive codecs, an mp3 file will take more cpu to decode than a PCM wav file.
    If you have a stuttering effect, then it is using more cpu than the decode buffer playback rate can keep up with.  Increasing the decode buffersize will most likely solve this problem.

    Structure defining a reverb environment.

    For more indepth descriptions of the reverb properties under win32, please see the EAX2 and EAX3
    documentation at http://developer.creative.com/ under the 'downloads' section.
    If they do not have the EAX3 documentation, then most information can be attained from
    the EAX2 documentation, as EAX3 only adds some more parameters and functionality on top of
    EAX2.

    [REMARKS]
    Note the default reverb properties are the same as the FMOD_PRESET_GENERIC preset.
    Note that integer values that typically range from -10,000 to 1000 are represented in 
    decibels, and are of a logarithmic scale, not linear, wheras float values are always linear.
    PORTABILITY: Each member has the platform it supports in braces ie (win32/xbox).  
    Some reverb parameters are only supported in win32 and some only on xbox. If all parameters are set then
    the reverb should product a similar effect on either platform.
    Win32/Win64 - This is only supported with FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_DSOUND and EAX compatible sound cards. 
    Macintosh - Currently unsupported.
    Linux - Currently unsupported.
    Xbox - Only a subset of parameters are supported.  
    PlayStation 2 - Only the Environment and Flags paramenters are supported. 
    GameCube - Only a subset of parameters are supported.
    
    The numerical values listed below are the maximum, minimum and default values for each variable respectively.
    
    Members marked with [in] mean the variable can be written to.  The user can set the value.
    Members marked with [out] mean the variable is modified by FMOD and is for reading purposes only.  Do not change this value.

    [REMARKS]
    maxMPEGcodecs / maxADPCMcodecs / maxXMAcodecs will determine the maximum cpu usage of playing realtime samples.  Use this to lower potential excess cpu usage and also control memory usage.<br>

    Memory will be allocated for codecs 'up front' (during System::init) if these values are specified as non zero.  If any are zero, it allocates memory for the codec whenever a file of the type in question is loaded.  So if maxMPEGcodecs is 0 for example, it will allocate memory for the mpeg codecs the first time an mp3 is loaded or an mp3 based .FSB file is loaded.

    Due to inefficient encoding techniques on certain .wav based ADPCM files, FMOD can can need an extra 29720 bytes per codec.  This means for lowest memory consumption.  Use FSB as it uses an optimal/small ADPCM block size.

    Set these values marked 'in' to tell fmod what sort of sound to create.
    The format, channels and frequency tell FMOD what sort of hardware buffer to create when you initialize your code.  So if you wrote an MP3 codec that decoded to stereo 16bit integer PCM, you would specify FMOD_SOUND_FORMAT_PCM16, and channels would be equal to 2.
    Members marked as 'out' are set by fmod.  Do not modify these.  Simply specify 0 for these values when declaring the structure, FMOD will fill in the values for you after creation with the correct function pointers.

    Members marked with [in] mean the variable can be written to.  The user can set the value.
    Members marked with [out] mean the variable is modified by FMOD and is for reading purposes only.  Do not change this value.
    
    An FMOD file might be from disk, memory or network, however the file may be opened by the user.
    
    'numsubsounds' should be 0 if the file is a normal single sound stream or sound.  Examples of this would be .WAV, .WMA, .MP3, .AIFF.
    'numsubsounds' should be 1+ if the file is a container format, and does not contain wav data itself.  Examples of these types would be CDDA (multiple CD tracks), FSB (contains multiple sounds), MIDI/MOD/S3M/XM/IT (contain instruments).
    The arrays of format, channel, frequency, length and blockalign should point to arrays of information based on how many subsounds are in the format.  If the number of subsounds is 0 then it should point to 1 of each attribute, the same as if the number of subsounds was 1.  If subsounds was 100 for example, each pointer should point to an array of 100 of each attribute.
    When a sound has 1 or more subsounds, you must play the individual sounds specified by first obtaining the subsound with FMOD_Sound_GetSubSound.

    The step parameter tells the gui or application that the parameter has a certain granularity.
    For example in the example of cutoff frequency with a range from 100.0 to 22050.0 you might only want the selection to be in 10hz increments.  For this you would simply use 10.0 as the step value.
    For a boolean, you can use min = 0.0, max = 1.0, step = 1.0.  This way the only possible values are 0.0 and 1.0.
    Some applications may detect min = 0.0, max = 1.0, step = 1.0 and replace a graphical slider bar with a checkbox instead.
    A step value of 1.0 would simulate integer values only.
    A step value of 0.0 would mean the full floating point range is accessable.

    Larger echo delays result in larger amounts of memory allocated.

    If the echo effect is only ever applied to the global mix (ie it was added with FMOD_System_AddDSP), then 0 is the value to set as it will be enough to handle all speaker modes.
    When the echo is added to a channel (ie FMOD_Channel_AddDSP) then the channel count that comes in could be anything from 1 to 8 possibly.  It is only in this case where you might want to increase the channel count above the output's channel count.
    If a channel echo is set to a lower number than the sound's channel count that is coming in, it will not echo the sound.

    Flange is an effect where the signal is played twice at the same time, and one copy slides back and forth creating a whooshing or flanging effect.

    Flange depth is a percentage of a 10ms shift from the original signal.  Anything above 10ms is not considered flange because to the ear it begins to 'echo' so 10ms is the highest value possible.

    [REMARKS]
    Normalize amplifies the sound based on the maximum peaks within the signal.
    For example if the maximum peaks in the signal were 50% of the bandwidth, it would scale the whole sound by 2.
    The lower threshold value makes the normalizer ignores peaks below a certain point, to avoid over-amplification if a loud signal suddenly came in, and also to avoid amplifying to maximum things like background hiss.
    
    Because FMOD is a realtime audio processor, it doesn't have the luxury of knowing the peak for the whole sound (ie it can't see into the future), so it has to process data as it comes in.
    To avoid very sudden changes in volume level based on small samples of new data, fmod fades towards the desired amplification which makes for smooth gain control.  The fadetime parameter can control this.

    Parameter types for the FMOD_DSP_TYPE_PITCHSHIFT filter.

    [REMARKS]
    This pitch shifting unit can be used to change the pitch of a sound without speeding it up or slowing it down.
    It can also be used for time stretching or scaling, for example if the pitch was doubled, and the frequency of the sound was halved, the pitch of the sound would sound correct but it would be twice as slow.
    
    <b>Warning!</b> This filter is very computationally expensive!  Similar to a vocoder, it requires several overlapping FFT and IFFT's to produce smooth output, and can require around 440mhz for 1 stereo 48khz signal using the default settings.
    Reducing the signal to mono will half the cpu usage, as will the overlap count.
    Reducing this will lower audio quality, but what settings to use are largely dependant on the sound being played.  A noisy polyphonic signal will need higher overlap and fft size compared to a speaking voice for example.
    
    This pitch shifter is based on the pitch shifter code at http://www.dspdimension.com, written by Stephan M. Bernsee.
    The original code is COPYRIGHT 1999-2003 Stephan M. Bernsee <smb@dspdimension.com>.
    
    '<i>maxchannels</i>' dictates the amount of memory allocated.  By default, the maxchannels value is 0.  If FMOD is set to stereo, the pitch shift unit will allocate enough memory for 2 channels.  If it is 5.1, it will allocate enough memory for a 6 channel pitch shift, etc.
    If the pitch shift effect is only ever applied to the global mix (ie it was added with FMOD_System_AddDSP), then 0 is the value to set as it will be enough to handle all speaker modes.
    When the pitch shift is added to a channel (ie FMOD_Channel_AddDSP) then the channel count that comes in could be anything from 1 to 8 possibly.  It is only in this case where you might want to increase the channel count above the output's channel count.
    If a channel pitch shift is set to a lower number than the sound's channel count that is coming in, it will not pitch shift the sound.

    [REMARKS]
    The limiter is not guaranteed to catch every peak above the threshold level,
    because it cannot apply gain reduction instantaneously - the time delay is
    determined by the attack time. However setting the attack time too short will
    distort the sound, so it is a compromise. High level peaks can be avoided by
    using a short attack time - but not too short, and setting the threshold a few
    decibels below the critical level.

    [DESCRIPTION]   
    Parameter types for the FMOD_DSP_TYPE_SFXREVERB unit.<br>
    
    [REMARKS]
    This is a high quality I3DL2 based reverb which improves greatly on FMOD_DSP_REVERB.<br>
    On top of the I3DL2 property set, "Dry Level" is also included to allow the dry mix to be changed.<br>
    <br>
    Currently FMOD_DSP_SFXREVERB_REFLECTIONSLEVEL, FMOD_DSP_SFXREVERB_REFLECTIONSDELAY and FMOD_DSP_SFXREVERB_REVERBDELAY are not enabled but will come in future versions.<br>
    <br>
    These properties can be set with presets in FMOD_REVERB_PRESETS.

    [DESCRIPTION]   
    Parameter types for the FMOD_DSP_TYPE_LOWPASS_SIMPLE filter.<br>
    This is a very simple low pass filter, based on two single-pole RC time-constant modules.
    The emphasis is on speed rather than accuracy, so this should not be used for task requiring critical filtering.<br>
