Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks - Release Notes
		  Version 2.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------


System Requirements
-------------------

Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (Intel(R) TBB) is available
commercially (see http://www.intel.com/software/products/threading) as a
binary distribution, and in open source, in both source and binary
forms (see http://threadingbuildingblocks.org).

When built from source, Intel(R) TBB is intended to be highly portable
and so supports a wide variety of operating systems and platforms (see
http://threadingbuildingblocks.org for more details).

Binary distributions, including commercial distributions, are validated
and officially supported for the hardware, software, operating systems
and compilers listed here.

Known Issues
------------

Please note the following with respect to this particular release of
Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks.

Library Issues

    - The atomic<long long> and atomic<unsigned long long> templates are
	not supported when using the Microsoft* Visual C++* 7.1
	(Microsoft* Visual Studio* .NET 2003) compiler.

    - Unhandled exceptions in the user code executed in the context of
	TBB algorithms or containers may lead to segmentation faults when
	Intel(R) C++ Compiler 10.x is used with glibc 2.3.2, 2.3.3, or 2.3.4.

    - To allow more accurate results to be obtained with Intel(R) Thread
	Checker or Intel(R) Thread Profiler, download the latest update
	releases of these products before using them with Intel(R)
	Threading Building Blocks.

    - If you are using Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks and OpenMP*
	constructs mixed together in rapid succession in the same
	program, and you are using Intel(R) compilers for your OpenMP*
	code, set KMP_BLOCKTIME to a small value (e.g., 20 milliseconds)
	to improve performance.  This setting can also be made within
	your OpenMP* code via the kmp_set_blocktime() library call.  See
	the Intel(R) compiler OpenMP* documentation for more details on
	KMP_BLOCKTIME and kmp_set_blocktime().

    - In general, non-debug ("release") builds of applications or
	examples should link against the non-debug versions of the
	Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks libraries, and debug builds
	should link against the debug versions of these libraries.  On
	Windows* systems, compile with /MD and use Intel(R) Threading
	Building Blocks release libraries, or compile with /MDd and use
	debug libraries; not doing so may cause run-time failures.  See
	the Tutorial in the product "doc" sub-directory for more details
	on debug vs. release libraries.
    
    - In some circumstances an exception thrown during concurrent_vector
	growth operation may deadlock other threads that also attempt to
	grow the vector. To prevent the issue, avoid going out of memory 
	and throwing exceptions in constructors of stored objects.

    - Installer doesn't accept non-commercial serial numbers on Red Hat* 
	Fedora* 11. To install the product on the system use license 
	file provided after registration of the serial number.
