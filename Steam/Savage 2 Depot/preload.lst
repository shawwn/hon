# This is the default master resource list which Steam uses to load
# resources into your cache file when your application is not running.
# You can add resources, or references to other reslists, in this file.
#
# Format:
#     <file name>                     Specifies an entire file for loading.
#     <file name> <offset> <length>   Specifies part of a file for loading.
#    @<file name>                     Specifies a reslist to open and load.
#
# This file has been initially created in a default location.  You may
# move it to any location that you like, however it must always be called
# 'reslists\preload.lst' in your depot.
