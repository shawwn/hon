The hero is able to attack and cast while mainting the stun, but if the hero moves away, the stun is removed from the enemy. He can keep it on for a certain number of max seconds. If the hero gets stunned, the effect ends. If anything forces the enemy hero to move, the effect ends.

Ability 2: Charge 
Description: This ability has 2 different aspects to it, a passive part and an active part. The hero gains a “container of energy” with this ability. When he uses the active part, the bottom of his staff glows and shows electricity being drain into it from the ground. This fills his container at a specific rate. When the container is full, if he continues to cast this (this is an unbounded channeling effect, can’t move/attack, but can cast) it will overcharge and release electricity in nearby area around him, damaging enemy units. 
The passive part of the ability causes a percentage of incoming damage to be absorbed by the energy in his container.

When the container is 50% full, the sharp point on his knee will glow, as shown in concept.
