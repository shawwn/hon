Ability 4
---------
Passive

The Hero's attack does stacking bonus damage based on a percentage of the damage dealt by the last attack made by the Hero.
This is marked by a stacking debuff on the attacked unit - the point being that the bonus damage is dealt only to units the Hero has previously hit. 

The bonus damage is purely based on the Hero's regular melee attacks and is unaffected by any spells he has that cause a unit damage. 

The bonus damage is "Pure".


---------------
// NOTE TO SELF:
// 1. apply state to enemy
// 2. in ondamaged in that state, check if the source of damage is the inflictor of the state.
// 3. the state_b.entity in there currently isn't being used.. nor are charges

WOrks like this:
stores all damage done, adds X% of it as your bonus
Example:
- Deal 100 damage on first attack, 0 bonus, stores 100 total damage done
- Deal 100 damage on attack, 10% * 100 stored damage = 10 bonus damage, store 210 total damage done
- deal 100, 21 bonus damage, store 331
- deal 100, 33 bonus, 464 stored

Applies a state that tracks this and refreshes on hit. State lasts a short duration (say, 5s or so)
