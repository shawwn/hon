Like DotA except for ability 3.

Ability 1:
----------
Slams the ground with his fist, sending a strong rumble/echo infront of him, stunning and damaging enemy units.


Ability 2:
----------
Picks up a unit and throws it towards target location, dealing damage to it and enemy units at that location. We should have a better visual interface for this


Ability 3:
----------
This is a different passive from what he has. It causes spell effects to last a shorter period of time and gives him increased armor.


Ultimate:
---------
Grows your hero. Gives you a stronger attack with a slightly slower attack speed. You move faster, throw harder, and slam further distance when you grow as well (slightly different from current)
