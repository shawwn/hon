This is functionally the same as witch doctor except for ability 2.



Ability 1:
----------
Releases a dark energy that zaps in and out of enemy units, briefly stunning and dealing minor damage to them.


Ability 2:
----------
Targets an allied or enemy or self. Heals or damages the target depending on alliance.



Ability 3:
----------
Targets an area. All units in the area get afflicted with a curse that reiterates a portion of the damage they took since the start of the curse. This happens a few times over the course of 12 seconds. There should be an effect that lasts the entire 12 seconds and then an effect that happens 3 or so times whenever the bonus damage is dealt.


Ultimate:
---------
His staff goes invisible and appears at targetted location. The main circle in it glows as it releases energy attacking the closest hero to it. He plays a channeling animation during this.
