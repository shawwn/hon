Ability 3:
----------
This may be an aoe or a single target spell. For now we'll do aoe but there is a good chance we'll want to revert it to a single target spell. Places an effect on target enemy unit for some time. This lowers the targets magic resistance and makes it so that whenever that unit takes damage, a portion of that damage is restored to you as life.

Extra notes: Range/Int/Bad. This is your classic evil Warlock style character. He doesn't need and probably shouldn't be based heavily on fire. That is reserved for his ultimate summon. He is more your classic warlock/caster with a special powerhouse summon.
