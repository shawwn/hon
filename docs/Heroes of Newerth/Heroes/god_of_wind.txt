Ultimate: Wind Control
========================
Description: This is a new type of casting. You target a location and then drag the mouse to the desitination location. This will define origin and direction. You then create a wind that starts from the origin and goes x distance with r radius in the direction defined. This wind will cause some things (projectile speed, movement speed, attack speed) to be increased or slowed depending on if the direction of the wind opposes the person inside it. This effects allies and enemies alike. The only exception is that it always works in favor of the casting hero. In this case the casting hero is  the God of Wind. However keep in mind that the ability needs to be coded to recognize the “casting hero”.
