There are two types of armor, Magical and Physical armor.

Damage reduction is defined as:

|Armor|*0.06
-------------    * 100 = Percentage Reduction
1+|Armor|*0.06


Examples:
=========
0 Armor = 0% Reduction
5 Armor = 23% Reduction
10 Armor = 37% Reduction
-5 Armor = -23% Reduction
-10 Armor = -37% Reduction

In Warcraft there is actually 2 different equations for positive and negative armor, but for simplicity sake, they will both use the same formula here.
