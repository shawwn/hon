I plan on having different levels of truesight. My main application will most likely be pointed towards truesight revealing units and truesight revealing wards. Truesight does not give vision in of itself, it reveals invisble things if you had vision in the area. Things right now can be either wards or units. Initially, the regular true sight wards will reveal both (as it does right now).
