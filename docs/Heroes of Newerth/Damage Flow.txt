Spells and Attacks both have various damage type classifications. The words "attack" and "spell" only serve as a high level categorization and classification. When it comes down to processing the damage, if its an attack you process the armor class reductions, then you process the damage type (physical/magical/pure) then you take into account armor resistance to that specific damage type.
