The UI for persistant stats is driven by one command and numerous triggers.

The command to retrieve stats for a player is:

ShowStats <name>

where <name> is the name of a player currently in the game.

This command will only work if that player is authenticated and has a valid account ID.

Once this is run, it will trigger several UI Triggers:

PersistantExperience
PersistantWins
PersistantLosses
PersistantTies
PersistantKills
PersistantDeaths
PersistantAssists
PersistantSouls
PersistantRazed
PersistantPlayerDamage
PersistantBuildingDamage
PersistantNPCDamage

The parameter for the triggers specifies the value. More will be added soon.
