-update changelog, commit
-edit shell_common.h to increment version #, commit it
-full rebuild. commit new build:

k2.dll

vid_d3d9.dll
/game/cgame.dll  
/game/game.dll 
/game/game_shared.dll
/editor/cgame.dll

- run /src/archive.bat to archive the pdb's

-if someone else has made the latest patch, copy over texture-high/med/low.s2z from beta directory to cvs
-launch CVS's savage2
-turn off host_dynamicresreload if it's on
-go to the different interfaces incase they have something new, load up the game
-run command "textureloadtime" it'll report any textures missing from the archives
-if missing, do "addtexturetoarchive <file name>" (by default this uses arguments '0 1 2' for different levels of quality) UNLESS it's an interface texture, then use "0 0 0" to not downsize
- do addvolumetexturetoarchive if it is an animated/multi pictured texture
-run command "generateupdate s2gpatch Pajerada" (this is username/password). will take a while.
