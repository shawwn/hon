BatchConvert.exe will do the following:
- Convert all TGA/PNG/JPGs to S2Ts
- Convert all WAVs to OGGs
- Copy all other files

BatchConvert.bat creates a new directory ("Converted")
All the new data is created there, and compression is fast/low quality
BatchConvertHQ.bat does the same thing, but with much higher texture quality

The HQ option only changes the compression time, NOT the load times.
There is NO disadvantage to using the HQ batch, except that converting
all the files might take hours instead of minutes on your computer.

The default OGG quality is 6, which sounds perfect to my ears and is
well known to be a good high quality option. You can edit the batch
file to change that if you want higher/lower quality though.

For optimal load times, all the folders in /game/ except /game/maps/
should be put in a .s2z file (read: renamed .zip file), in order to
let the preload system do its magic and reduce file size further...
