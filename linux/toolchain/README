Installation Instructions:

Run the install script either on a linux system or from within cygwin. Everything gets installed under /opt/toolchain. Note that it won't work elsewhere without changing a number of paths in the toolchain binaries/scripts (by using a tool such as the one from crosstool)
	sh install.sh

Uninstallation Instructions:

Delete /opt/toolchain
	rm -rf /opt/toolchain
